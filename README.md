# rootsup

Hi here are some edits by me kc

"rootsup" is a website that promotes a healthy lifestyle. On this website, users are able to earn points from performing healthy actions (e.g., running, drinking water). Depending on the activity, a different amount of points may be earned. For example, the *amount* of water dranken and *hours spent* running affects the amount of points received.

## Motivation
Our team wanted to create this project in order to motivate everyone to take care of their well-beings! By incentivizing users to workout or eat well, more people can kick-start healthy living.
